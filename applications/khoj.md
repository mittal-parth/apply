# üíé Khoj

## üåü Project Overview

- **Tagline**: Participate in AI-personalised treasure hunts where each clue is a physical location. Earn on-chain rewards and onboard a million users.
- **Description**: Khoj (meaning "search" or "discovery" in Hindi) is a gamified geo-location based treasure hunt platform that combines real-world exploration with Web3 technology.
  It allows users to participate in location-based AI treasure hunts where they solve riddles, visit physical locations, and earn on-chain rewards.
- **Integration with Polkadot**: The application smart contract (which includes token creation and NFTs) will be deployed on the Polkadot Blockchain.
- **Motivation**: The desire started off in college when we wanted to onboard the new joinees of our tech club with a different experience that combines Web3 with the real world in a gamified manner. Since then, we haven't found a platform that solves this our way, and we would love to solve this to onboard not just our club members but go beyond.

### üß© Ecosystem Fit

- _Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?_: The main aim is to increase adoption and onboard more users to Polkadot in a gamified manner. Create an application that feels Web2 but onboards users to the Polkadot ecosystem. 
- _Who is your target audience?_ The game can be played by anyone as the use cases are broad.
  But the focus can be on  local communities, blockchain projects, DAOs, educational institutions, and event organizers ‚Äî essentially anyone looking to drive real-world engagement through interactive, location-based experiences. Also, the majority of the  Polkadot ecosystem is desktop-focused. Even though wallets have their apps like SubWallet/the Polkadot App, there are few applications that leverage this smartphone first experience. Apart from the enthusiasts, the larger web2 native audience is on mobile. We want to capture this audience to transition into the Web3 world. 
- _Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Polkadot ecosystem?_: No
  - _If not, why might such a project not exist yet?_ There is slight synonimity with Pok√©mon Go, but otherwise the concept of Khoj is novel. It's not present on any blockchain, let alone Polkadot.

### What are we trying to solve?

1. Lack of Engagement in Web3 Adoption: Web3 adoption faces barriers due to its technical complexity and lack of relatable, engaging entry points for non-technical users.
2. Decline in Real-World Exploration: In a digital era, people often miss out on physical-world experiences.
3. Limited Interactive Marketing for Brands and DAOs: Brands and blockchain communities struggle to engage users meaningfully.

### What has been done so far?

[Explanation Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJ4OCtnvjUY&t=4718s)

1. Users can discover active hunts and register for them. An NFT is generated as a proof of registration.
2. Users can see the clues, move to a location and verify if the answer is correct upto 3 times. The Geolocation API is used to detect the user's location.
3. Clues that are visible to each user are passed via [Claude](https://www.anthropic.com/claude) to generate different clues for the same answer.
4. Integration with Huddle01 for real-time video chat and streaming to YouTube.  
5. Game completion and rewards page mock-up.
6. Smart contract design with all the basic features required.
7. Integration with Lit Protocol for blind computation of the location verification and encryption of clue answers.
8. Usage of IPFS for encrypted data storage
9. Integration with True Network to attest every solved clue on-chain and generate a Trust Score for final reward distribution. 

### What has NOT been done?

A. Team based gameplays. Currently users cannot form teams to play, only individual users can register. Since the game involves moving around and aims to encourage community building, its essential to have team based plays available. This will require changes across the contract and frontend.

B. Huddles (real-time video chat) should create a room for just the team members using NFT gated rooms, which users get as part of registration.

C. The location verification algorithm is not consistent yet. Needs work for deterministic gameplay since this forms the backbone.

D. Even the a Trust Score is generated, actual reward distribution has not been worked on. Once hunt gets over / the top, x teams should automatically be distributed rewards, and the game should either be stopped for everyone else / allowed to be continued with reduced/very few rewards. 

E. There is no interface for the Treasure Hunt and thereby Clue creation. All of it was done manually. It has lots of moving parts like adding the hunt metadata, seed clue description, attach an exact GPS coordinate from the map as the answer, decide the clue order, encrypt the clues via Lit Protocol, store the metadata on Walrus, obtain the blobIds and add them on-chain and attach/configure rewards with the hunt.

F. Unit tests for the smart contract and frontend.

G. Replace Claude with the Perplexity Sonar API for more real-time, location-aware clue generation. 

H. Ironing out, bug fixes, and UI improvements.

### üí∞ Budget Breakdown

Please provide a breakdown of your budget by milestone:

| Milestone | Deliverables              | Cost (USD) | Estimated Completion |
|-----------|---------------------------|------------|-----------------------|
| 1         | Features 1, 2, 3 and 7    | $2,740     | 1.5 months            |
| 2         | Features 4, 5, 6 and 8    | $1,760     | 1 month               |
| **Total** |                           | **$4,500** | **2.5 months**        |

**Budget Calculation:**

- 4 developers √ó 40 hours/month = **160 hours/month**
- 160 hours √ó $11/hour = **$1,760/month**
- Total project duration = **2.5 months**

So:

- 1.5 months (Milestone 1):  
  ‚Üí 160 hours √ó 1.5 √ó $11 = **$2,640** + $100 for miscellenous costs* = **$2,740**
- 1 full month (Milestone 2):  
  ‚Üí 160 hours √ó $11 = **$1,760**

*Miscellaneous costs = contract deployment, API usage, etc

**Final Total = $2,640 + $1,760 + $100 = $4,500**

## üîÆ Future Plans

- The main focus would then be on marketing and taking the product out there for testing, getting user feedback.
- We want to keep the funding minimal and raise only as much as required. VC Funding is not something we want to raise in the near future.
- The vision is to become the answer for the most distincitve way to drive engagement, become an interesting funnel to gain users to Polkadot.
- Some near goals are to conduct hunts at smaller Polkadot specific events, community meetups, JAM tour events and hackathons - ETHIndia'25 being a target.
- One goal close to heart is to become a standard part of each PBA cohort experience, unique to each new location :)
